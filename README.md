# Learn-Mysql-python

I have been learning database management using SQL in MySQL, focusing on fundamental concepts like creating and managing tables, writing queries, and implementing constraints to ensure data integrity. Through hands-on practice, I gained proficiency in performing CRUD operations, using joins for multi-table queries, and optimizing database performance with indexing. Eventually, I advanced to integrating MySQL with Python using libraries like mysql-connector-python, which allowed me to interact with databases programmatically. As a culmination of my learning, I designed and implemented a detailed database schema (DDL) for a project inspired by Bikroy.com, where I created tables for users, products, categories, and orders, ensuring proper relationships and scalability to handle real-world application requirements
